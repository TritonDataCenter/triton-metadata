# triton-metadata

The Metadata server that runs on a Triton compute node.

This branch is deliberately empty. The metadata server for SmartOS lives in the
[smartos-live](https://github.com/joyent/smartos-live/tree/master/src/vm/lib/metadata)
repository. The Linux metadata server resides in this repository in the
[linuxcn](https://github.com/joyent/triton-metadata/tree/linuxcn) branch.
